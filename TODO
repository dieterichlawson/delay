Airport Offset Table:
  - update code to detect API limits (DONE - needs test)
  - look into deprecated fields
  - update code to memoize certain reqs (DONE - needs test)
  - include country in download, and then filter out non-US airports
  - run script and give final offset table to Will
Joining NOAA and BTS
  - get WBAN -> Seq ID mapping ready for prime time
  - Run Will's script to convert delay dataset to UTC
  - Aggregate NOAA dataset, keyed by Sq ID and UTC time
  - Join mothafucka
