✓ Airport Offset Table: DONE
  ✓ update code to detect API limits  
  ✓ look into deprecated fields
  ✓ update code to memoize certain reqs 
  ✓ include country in download, and then filter out non-US airports
  ✓ run script and give final offset table to Will
Transform BTS data to UTC
  - Ensure that download script has all necessary columns and no more
  - write script that loads airport DST offset table into memory and transforms BTS data
  - Test script on a month or two
  - Wukong-ize script
  - After cluster setup, download all BTS data and run on cluster
✓ Other postprocessing for BTS data
  ✓ remove all cancelled flights
  ✓ remove all diverted flights
  ✓ add previous flight arrival delay
Joining NOAA and BTS
  - get WBAN -> Seq ID mapping ready for prime time
  - Run Will's script to convert delay dataset to UTC
  - Aggregate NOAA dataset, keyed by Sq ID and UTC time
  - Join mothafucka
Explorations
  - look into how to handle categorical variables
  - make sure dummyvar is working
  - Naive Bayes + Laplace smoothing
  - Logistic regression
  - SVM
Cluster setup
  - set up the cluster
